# Reflection

##Estimates:
My accuracy on my estimates has gotten better, however I find myself going over my 
estimate majority of the time due the debugging taking longer. I started taking 
this into consideration, during the Assignment 2 project. However, I still need to 
improve my estimation.

##Code Reviews:
Being reviewed I learned that I tend to have incorrect format for my doc strings or 
have unnecessary comments/line docstrings. In providing reviews I learned that 
I was not the only one that encounter certain bugs. It also helped me become more 
efficient when I code.

##Practical Task:
I think the practicals are of great help, I would add more make from scratch kind 
of tasks. Even though I struggled on some of them it was a good indication of my 
understanding of the chapter.
