# CP1404 Programming II Weekly Coding Practicals

I am Rusty, an Engineering student, doing programming II as a minor subject. I have done python before, however I have
recently learned that all the assumption I had were wrong. The coding tht I know is so different that this one.

## The Practical Instructions

- All practical instructions were acquired from
  the [CP1404 Practical Instruction Repository](https://github.com/CP1404/Practicals)

## The Programming Pattern

- In writing the following programs I Attempted to use [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) as the primary
  programming pattern.

## This Repository Contains:

- File folders labeled prac_0x where x is the week it is for.
- Python file for each task that are stored in their corresponding folder.
- Supporting Files like, txt, csv and other files.

## Some of the things that I have learned from clean coding are:

- How to use python loop convention, when to use while or for.
- How to name variables properly, so it satisfies the python convention.
- Not to use While True
- The importance of docstrings
